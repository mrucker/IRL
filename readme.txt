Core, reusable functionality such as algorithms and visualizations can be found in the IRL directory.

One off experiments and visualizations which utilize the core code can be found in the scripts directory.

Implementations of application specific features, kernels, and models can be found in IRL/domains.

Unit tests for all algorithms can be found in IRL/tests.

Dependencies can be installed to the `irl` conda environment via `conda env create --f environment.yml`. Afterwards use `conda activate irl` to switch to this environment.
